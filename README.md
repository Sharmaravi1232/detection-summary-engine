# detection-summary-engine
🧠 Detection Summary Engine
Detection Summary Engine is a lightweight object detection and video analytics pipeline that uses pretrained deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) to extract meaningful summaries from short video clips. It provides per-frame object metadata, class frequency analysis, and visual outputs for further insights.

📌 Features
Leverages pretrained object detection models like YOLOv5 or Faster R-CNN.

Processes every 5th frame from a 15–20 second .mp4 video.

Generates JSON output per frame containing:

Detected class labels

Bounding box coordinates

Confidence scores

Counts total objects per class across the video.

Identifies the frame with the highest class diversity.

Visualizes object frequency using a bar chart.

(Optional) Saves annotated frames or compiles an output video with bounding boxes.

📸 Example

Frame 35 contains the highest class diversity: ['person', 'car', 'dog', 'bicycle']

🧪 Models Supported
YOLOv5 (via Ultralytics PyTorch Hub)

Faster R-CNN (via torchvision.models.detection)

You can easily extend the project to integrate custom models.

📍 Future Improvements

what should i name to reopsitory name of this projects 

ChatGPT said:
Great question! A good GitHub repository name should be:

Descriptive of the project's purpose

Concise and easy to remember

Use lowercase with hyphens or underscores (e.g., detection-summary or video-object-summarizer)

Avoid generic names like object-detection unless it’s part of a larger library

🔧 Recommended Repository Name Options for Your Project:
detection-summary-engine ✅ (matches your current title)

video-object-summary

object-detection-summarizer

video-insight-extractor

framewise-object-analyzer

object-detection-insights

video-detection-dashboard

smart-video-analyzer
